I realized while studying for SANS exams that the mere act of creating an index as I read the books made me retain the info better. I wasn't actually using my index much, if at all, during the exam. Hence I started indexing other exams as well that aren't even open book.
The All in One is Book # 1.
The Sybeb book is Book # 2.

Good luck! You got this.

Study well my friends.
