My index, notes, and someone else's notes from CompTIA Project+

I realized awhile ago that I wasn't really using my index during SANS exams. However the act of creating the index as I read the books forced me to pay better attention to the material and 'actively read'. Hence I started indexing as I studied for other exams that aren't even open book. 

The .xlsx is my index from reading the Sybex and Pearson Vue Project+ books. Sybex is 'book 1', Pearson is 'book 2'. 

The .docx is my notes in bullet point form with some charts that you need to know for the exam.

The PDF is someone else's notes I got from Reddit or Google. I didn't really use them myself, but if they help you then great.

Good luck! You got this.

Study well my friends.
